- Splitting out modules from provisioning repo to allow for versioning
  - e.g. github/modules/my-module-1@2.1.1
- IAC platform such as terraform cloud to allow for larger teams

  - think about the blast radius of single states (e.g. 1 per environment) vs the manageability of linked states (e.g. instances and load balancers being seperate)
