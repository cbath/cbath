## DX

- Where do developers spend most of their day
  - Jira
  - VS Code
  - GitHub
- Where do they want to
- How to maximize the ones they want to with integrations and automation

### Small but Every Day

- variable and column names
- what is easy to select and search in VS Code


### Documentation

Risk of drift
Keep close to the code

Other forms of documentation:

- comments
- explanatory variables
