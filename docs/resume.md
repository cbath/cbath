## Profile

Determined to continually build on my existing portfolio of skills, I welcome the challenge of learning new technologies and methods that will improve both my technical and business solutions.

## Education

BSc (Hons) Mathematics: First Class (GPA: 79.4 %)

Liverpool John Moores University, England (2011 – 2014)

Modules Including; Statistical Modelling, Linear Algebra, Multivariate Analysis and Data Mining.

## Skills

### Software Engineering (q, kdb+, Python)

As a senior engineer, my primary responsibilities are the research, design and implementation of data in-gestion and reporting frameworks that scale with large data volumes as well as increased client usage. I also work towards ensuring junior resources are able to contribute and support any system created going forward.

### DevOps (git, GitHub, Docker, Linux , Fluentd, Prometheus, AWS )

As part of the migration of the MRP Prelytix project towards a cloud native solution, I’ve been responsible for the research & implementation of architecture relating to backend containerisation, horizontal & verti-cal scaling, automated testing and CI/CD.

### Data Attribution & Cleansing

Lead developer for the attribution of data, to an account level, across multiple disparate data sources across the business as well as providing generic solutions for client re-use. Used as part of my work at FD, to unify the results of independent marketing tactics (e.g. Inside Sales, IP Tracking and Online display Ad-vertisements) for analysis at an account level. This was achieved through the creation of matching algo-rithms in kdb+ to attribute data to a common “account” through a series of matching algorithms.

### Data Science (Python, Binary Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Analysis, Data Clustering & Neural Networks)

I have a great comprehension of statistical and mathematical software and methodologies, which have been vital throughout my degree and are critical in my professional work. Studying the methods a software application offers prior to in depth analysis, I ensure suitable techniques are applied based on the data available and the objectives of the project. I have experience in researching and implementing machine learning models, creating data driven recommendations for a variety of departments within a business. This includes in depth testing to ensure model overfitting is minimised and performance is more likely to be maintained when applied to future data.

### Business Intelligence & Reporting (SQL Server, MySQL, SSRS & kdb+)

Essential in both my roles as a BI developer and Data Scientist, providing and displaying data insights as well as making necessary modifications and updates to databases and tables.

### A/B Testing

Providing technical expertise in the implementation of Sykes Holiday Cottages’ first A/B testing platform as well as part of my work for FD. My role consisted of investigating and explaining the statistical methods appropriate for the data available, so that an in-house solution could be provided. This included test statis-tics, confidence intervals, minimum sample sizes and the statistical interpretations of results.

### Communication

My written skills which were enhanced by regularly writing investigative reports during my university de-gree and are continually improved in my work. After carrying out robust data analysis, for areas such as personalised recommendation systems, I compile results into an informative report where conclusions are displayed in a clear and concise manner ensuring the reader, regardless of statistical background, can un-derstand my findings and business recommendations.

Verbally, it was crucial in both my roles, heading the BI support team at Sykes Holiday Cottages and also as a senior developer to help more junior developers on improving the quality of their code during code re-views as well as providing advice around deadline management.

## Work Experience

### First Derivatives (FD) /KX Systems

On the soft skillset side, as part of the design & implementation of new or overhauled architecutres is to clearly explain design decisions and how best to implement them in an agile

### Sykes Holiday Cottages

Business Intelligence Developer (08/12/2014 – 28/06/2016)

As part of a rapidly growing company in the travel industry, I received great experience in applying my mathematical and IT skills to multiple areas including finance, marketing, customer services, and supplier care. Utilising a variety of software, my role consisted of investigative analysis, building reports, extracting data, and aiding in database maintenance. The role also expanded into producing data mining solutions, covering areas such as conversion rate optimisation and customer retention.

Revival Gardens

### Landscaping Team Leader (02/05/2012 – 31/01/2014)
